### 📌 Overview

This project explores **30,000+ supply chain transactions** over a 3-year span to identify inefficiencies, analyze customer behavior, and derive actionable business insights.

Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and dashboard design, this project showcases how even messy datasets can be transformed into strategies that uncover **\$2.3M+ in efficiency improvements**.

### 🧩 Datasets Used

* `Orders & Shipments.csv` – Order details and shipping timelines
* `Inventory.csv` – Monthly product stock logs
* `Fulfillment.csv` – Fulfillment channel and shipping class data

---

### 📈 Key Metrics & Insights

* **Net Sales** and **Profit Margin** calculated per order
* Identified **chronic stockouts** (e.g., webcams missing for 23/36 months)
* Highlighted **shipping delays** in Standard and Second-Class fulfillment
* Discovered **peak order times** (Fridays, 2–4 PM) for targeted marketing
* Segmented customers to identify high-value repeat buyers
